election is our best hope to protect future generations
from an uninhabitable planet. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change has said we need to cut
global emissions in half by 2030 to have a chance of
keeping global heating within safe limits - that means
acting now, and acting decisively.
The Tories wasted a decade serving the interests of
big polluters. Labour will use the crucial next decade
to act. The Tories slashed support for renewable
energy while pushing through dangerous fracking.

9                                 will make Britain’s public services the best and most
extensive in the world.
We will pay for this by creating a fairer taxation system,
asking for a little more from those with the broadest
shoulders, and making sure that everyone pays what
they owe.
We will reverse some of the Tories’ cuts to corporation
tax while keeping rates lower than in 2010.
We'll ask those who earn more than £80,000 a year to
pay a little more income tax, while freezing National
Insurance and income tax rates for everyone else.

Public services must also be
accountable. Labour will end the
current presumption in favour of
outsourcing public services and
introduce a presumption in favour of
insourcing. And we will stop the public
getting ripped off by taking back all
PFI contracts over time.
When services are procured from
the private sector, companies will be
assessed against best practice public
service criteria, including provisions
for collective bargaining, fair wage
clauses, adherence to environmental
standards, effective equalities policies,
full tax compliance and application of
pay ratios. In the public sector, we will
enforce maximum pay ratios of 20:1.
We will repair the damage the Tories
have done to our social fabric, with
a £150 billion Social Transformation
Fund to replace, upgrade and expand
our schools, hospitals, care homes and
council houses. Public buildings will be
modernised to ensure a reduction in
their carbon footprint.

the root causes of rising homelessness

Labour will end rough sleeping within

five years, with a national plan driven by

them into places where people can

an additional £1 billion a year for

councils’ homelessness services.

ensure that its collective strength

is focused on tackling the climate
emergency, tax evasion and ending
austerity and inequality.

The EU needs a new political direction
and, if the people decide the UK
should remain in the EU, Labour will
lead the way to ensure that change.
For too long a politically inflicted wave
of austerity has damaged communities
across Britain and across Europe.

The most vulnerable members in

our society have suffered, while the
super-rich continue to be rewarded by
a system that allows them to thrive at
the expense of the manu.

This must change. If the country
decides to remain, a Labour
government will take a different
approach and strive to ensure that
the EU works for people across our
communities. The EU should focus on
policies that value investment, protect
public services and make those who
have the most pay their fair share.

If people decide to leave, a Labour
government will work constructively
with the EU on vital issues of mutual
interest and to the mutual benefit of
the UK and EU. But we will leave the EU.
Most importantly, under a Labour
government, you will get the final

say on Brexit.
