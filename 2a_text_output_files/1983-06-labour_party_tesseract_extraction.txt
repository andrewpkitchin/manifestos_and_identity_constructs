of representative democracy. Millions of people have endured a lifetime of oppression and
deprivation. In recent years, the pressure for social change to respond to basic needs has grown
intense. but has met with the firm resistance of the wealthy and the powerful, invariably backed
by Washington. This is true of El Salvador. Nicaragua and Guatemala. Labour rejects US policy
in Central America. Regrettably, the Tory government has connected Britain with that policy by
its slavish support for everything the Reagan administration says and does. This applies even in
the case of Guatemala. which the US is re-arming, when it lays claim to Belize. to whose defence                                           ,

FALKLAND ISLANOS
Mrs Thatcher's policy of Fortress Fulkdands is imposing an intolerable burden both on the British
people and on the inhabitants of the Falklands themselves. The war. which wiser policies could
have avoided, have already cost us £1,000 million. On top of that the Conservative government
plans to spend £60 million a year for the indefinite future on garrisoning the islands — £1):
million per vear for every Falklands family.
With four British servicemen on the islands to every adult male Falklander, the traditional way
of life of this rural community is being destroyed. Yet at the same time Mrs Thatcher is allowing
British firms to equip warships for the Argentine dictatorship and is lending money to General
Bignune to spend oa arms. A Labour government would not sell arms to any Argentine
government which was hostile to Britain or denied civil rights and democratic freedoms to is
