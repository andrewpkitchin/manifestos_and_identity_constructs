We have a plan for every stage of your life:
FOR THE BEST START IN LIFE
we will continue to increase spending on the NHS, provide 7-day a week access to your GP
and deliver a truly 7-day NHS — so you know you will always have access to a free and high quality
health service when you need it most.
FOR YOUR SCHOOL YEARS
we will maintain the amount of money that follows each child into school, ensure there is a good
primary school place available for every child and lift the cap on university places — so you have the
skills you need to succeed.
TO SECURE YOUR FIRST JOB
we will create 3 million new apprenticeships; take everyone earning less than £12,500 out of Income
Tax altogether and pass a law to ensure we have a Tax-Free Minimum Wage in this country; and
continue to create a fairer welfare system where benefits are capped to the level that makes work pay
— so you are rewarded for working hard and doing the right thing.
AS YOU RAISE YOUR FAMILY
we will extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants, build 200,000 new Starter Homes
— 20 per cent below the market price, for first-time buyers under 40 — and provide 30 hours of free
childcare to working parents of three and four year-olds — so you are able to work while having the
security of your own home in which to raise your family.
WHILE YOU GROW OLDER
we will not raise VA'E, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax but we will raise the 40p
Income Tax threshold to £50,000 and take the family home out of tax by increasing the effective
Inheritance ‘Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million — so you can keep
more of your income and pass it on to future generations.
AND WHEN YOU RETIRE
we will continue to increase the Basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent through the triple lock,
give you the freedom to use your pension savings as you want and pass them on tax-free and we
will cap the amount you can be charged for your residential care — so you can have the dignity and
security you deserve in your old age.
The next Conservative Government will secure a better
future for you, your family and Britain.

Foreword
Over the last five years, we have put our country back on the right track. Five years ago, Britain was on the brink. As the
outgoing Labour ‘Treasury Minister put it with brutal candour, ‘there is no money’. Since then, we have turned things around.
Britain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. We are getting our national finances back under
control. We have halved our deficit as a share of our economy. More people are in work than ever before. Britain is back on
its feet, strong and growing stronger every day.
This has not happened by accident. It is the result of difficult decisions and of patiently working through our long-term
economic plan. Above all, it is the product of a supreme national effort, in which everyone has made sacrifices and everyone
has played their part.
It is a profound Conservative belief that our country is made great not through the action of government alone, but
through the flair, the ingenuity and hard work of the British people — and so it has proved the last five years.
We can be proud of what we have achieved so far together, and especially proud that as we have taken hard decisions on
public spending, we have protected the National Health Service, with 9,500 more doctors and 6,900 more nurses, and
ensured generous rises in the State Pension.
Our friends and competitors overseas look at Britain, and they see a country that is putting its own house in order, a country
on the rise. ‘They see a country that believes in itself! But our national recovery remains a work in progress. It is fragile, and
with the wrong decisions, it could easily be reversed.
So the central questions at this election are these: how do we maintain our economic recovery, upon which our ambitions for
our country depend? And how do we make sure that the recovery benefits every one of our citizens, at every stage of their lives?
This Manifesto sets out our plan to do just that. It is a plan for a better future — for you, for your family. It is a plan for
every stage of your life. For your new-born baby, there will be the world's best medical care. For your child, there will be a
place at an excellent school. As you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career
for you with a decent income. As you look for that first home, we will make sure the Government is there to help. As you
raise your family, we will help you with childcare. And as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement.
Throughout, we will make sure that if you or your family fall ill, you will always be able to depend on our cherished
National Health Service to give you the care you need.
And in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, we will fulfil the most basic duty of government — to defend our
country and keep it safe.
But all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy. So as you consider how to vote, I hope you will ask this:
which party 1s best placed to keep our economy strong? The team which has delivered the growing economy we have today,
which created more jobs since 2010 than the rest of the European Union put together; or the party which left behind a
ruined economy just five short years ago?
Now is a time to build on the progress we have made, not to put it all at risk. ‘This Manifesto is our plan of action — our plan
to take our amazing country forward. Above all, it is a plan for you.
-               SO                      o that together, we can see through the task we have begun.

Conclusion
SO THIS IS OUR DETAILED PLAN FOR BRITAIN.
Our plan to entrench the progress of the past five years. Our plan for you and your
family, at every stage of your life.
IT IS UNDERPINNED BY SOME SIMPLE CONSERVATIVE VALUES.
Those who work hard and do the right thing must be rewarded. Everyone should
be able to rise as high as their talents and effort will take them. We measure
our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for
the weakest and most vulnerable at home.
ABOVE ALL, RUNNING THROUGH THIS PLAN
IS A TRUE BELIEF IN BRITAIN.
In the past five years, as so often before in our history, we have once again
defied the expectations of the world to rise up and meet our challenges. The British
character is renewed every day by the millions who work hard, raise their families, care for
those who need help, who do the right thing — and make this country what it is.
THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE LIVES
OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.
Together we have come so far. If we stick to our long-term plan, we can secure
a better future for you and your family. So let us keep moving forward; and set our sights
on making our great country greater still.
