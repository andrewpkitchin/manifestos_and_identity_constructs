and Reform UksNeeds You© Reform UK: Our Contract with You

Our Contract with You is not just another party manifesto. It sets out the reforms that

Britain needs in the first 100 days following a general election and thereafter. It has been

produced with advice from a range of independent economists, think tanks and advisors on

costs and savings.

Costings can be found at the end of each policy page. Some policy areas come with net

costs and others with net savings. We have also included extra growth assumptions

from our economic reforms. Final annualised budget calculations across a 5 year term of

government can be found at the end of this Contract.

We are impatient for change. We are doers and achievers. Our Contract

with You will be delivered by people with a real track record of success.

REFORM UK20%00som) ) Reform UK: Our Contract with You
Fourteen years of Tory failure are coming to an end. A Labour government would ramp up mass
immigration, crime, and taxes even further. Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin.
Only Reform UK is ready to stand up for common sense politics. We set out our plan in this
document, Our Contract with You. Wherever you look, Britain needs Reform.
Our Contract with You covers the most important areas of policy for you and your family, but we
have summarised these into five core pledges:
1. Imagine Smart Immigration, Not Mass Immigration
All non-essential immigration frozen to boost wages, protect public services,
end the housing crisis and cut crime.
2. Imagine No More Small Boats in the Channel
Illegal migrants who come to the UK will be detained and deported. And if
needed, migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France.
3. Imagine No NHS Waiting Lists
Still free at the point of delivery, healthcare needs reform to improve outcomes
and enjoy zero NHS waiting lists. Cut back office waste to spend more money
on the frontline. Tax breaks for doctors and nurses to tackle the staffing crisis.
4. Imagine Good Wages for a Hard Day’s Work
Lift the income tax starting threshold to £20k to save the lowest paid £1,500
per year. This takes 7 million of the least well-off out of Income Tax to make
work pay and get people off benefits.
5. Imagine Affordable, Stable Energy Bills
Scrap energy levies and Net Zero to slash energy bills and save each household
£500 per year. Unlock Britain’s vast oil and gas reserves to beat
the cost of living crisis and unleash real economic growth.
This is what
Reform UK MPs will
fight hard for if elected.
So if you want change,
vote for it on July 4th.
