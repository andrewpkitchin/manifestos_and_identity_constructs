M@ The new Labour case
For generations our country has been held back by an education sys-
tem that excelled for the privileged few but let down the majority.
Every child can and should be able to fulfil their potential. We will
achieve this by uniting our commitment to equal opportunities for all
children with a reform programme which gives every child and young
person, from pre-school to sixth-form or apprenticeship and beyond,
the personalised package of learning and support they need. In a third
term, we will entrench high expectations for every child, ensure the
flexibility of provision to meet all needs and make parents true part-
ners as we aim for the highest ever school standards.

need strong communities built on mutual respect and the rule of law.
We prize the liberty of the individual; but that means protecting the
law-abiding majority from the minority who abuse the system. We
believe in being tough on crime and its causes so we will expand drugs
testing and treatment, and tackle the conditions — from lack of youth
provision to irresponsible drinking — that foster crime and anti-social
behaviour. In a third term we will make the contract of rights and
responsibilities an enduring foundation of community life.

Overall crime as measured by the authoritative British Crime Survey
is down 30 per cent — the equivalent of almost five million fewer crimes
a year. Record numbers of police — almost 13,000 more than in 1997
— working with 4,600 new Community Support Officers (CSOs),
local councils, and the Crown Prosecution Service deserve the credit.
But local people want a more visible police presence and a role in

allow smoking or to be smoke-free. In membership clubs the members

® Tackling pensioner poverty:
The success of the Pension Credit
In 1997, 2.8 million pensioners were living in poverty — with the poor-
est expected to live on just £69 per week. Labour’s Pension Credit
now means that no pensioner need live on less than £109 per week. It
rewards saving and helps over three million pensioners, with women in
particular benefiting. We will increase Pension Credit in line with earn-
ings up to and including 2007-08.
All pensioners have benefited from improved universal benefits like
the state pension, the Winter Fuel Payment (now worth £300 per year
for the over-80s), help with council tax and free TV licences for the
over-75s. This year, all households expected to pay council tax that

Millions of pensioners have benefited from our fuel poverty pro-

2010, and for all by 2015.

We need to forge a national consensus about how we move from a
pension system designed for today’s pension problems to one that is
right for tomorrow’s. We appointed the Pensions Commission to look
into the future of pensions and its second report is due in autumn
2005. We are clear about the goals of a reformed system. It must tack-
le poverty, provide everyone with the opportunity to build an adequate
retirement income, and be affordable, fair and simple to understand.
In particular it must address the disadvantages faced by women.

® Tackling child poverty
We will end child poverty, starting by halving it — both in terms of rel-
ative low-income and in terms of material deprivation — by 2010-11.
Work is the best anti-poverty strategy. Tailored help, especially for lone
parents, is key but we are also committed to making work pay — with a
guaranteed income of at least £258 per week for those with children
and in full-time work.
The benefits system needs to support all children, and those in great-
est need the most. That is the rationale for universal child benefit and
targeted tax credits, and why we have committed to increasing the

® Supporting family life
Common sense, as well as research, says that children need to be able
to depend on the love and support of both parents. The financial sup-
port we are giving families, along with new rights to flexible working
and access to childcare, are all designed to support family life.
Government can and should support those public and voluntary agen-
cies that support families and parents. We are examining the develop-
ment of a new information service — Parents Direct — to provide advice
on all aspects of children’s services and parental entitlements.                                                 rq C h 1 i} dren   canno t  be

§® Social housing
The increased supply and quality of social housing is central to
Labour’s belief in mixed, sustainable communities.
Since 1997, we have cut the number of substandard social-rented
homes by one million; installing 300,000 new kitchens, 220,000 new
bathrooms and 720,000 new boilers and central heating systems into
council homes. By 2010 we will ensure that all social tenants benefit
from a decent, warm home with modern facilities.
For too long, tenants have had little say over where they live. In a third
term, Labour will offer greater flexibility and choice for those who
rent. We will increase the annual supply of new social homes by 50 per
cent by 2008, an extra 10,000 homes a year, and give local authorities

lM Creative cities
Art and culture are valuable for their own sake; they are also crucial to
our national prosperity. Britain’s cultural industries now make up over
eight per cent of our national income; and from computer games to
the fine arts, British talent is gaining global recognition and generating
real wealth. This is one of the fastest growing and fastest changing
areas of the economy. And the transformation of our great cities is, in
great part, a story of culture-led regeneration. We are proud of the
record of Labour-led councils in leading this transformation, from
Gateshead to Greenwich.
To help young talent get the right start we will work to establish
Creative Apprenticeships. Through the National Endowment for

People want a sense of control over their own neighbourhood. Not a
new tier of neighbourhood government, but new powers over the
problems that confront them when they step outside their front door —
issues like litter, graffiti and anti-social behaviour. That is why we will
offer neighbourhoods a range of powers from which they can choose,
including:
* New powers for parish councils to deal with anti-social behaviour.
* Powers for local people to trigger action in response to persistent local
problems.
* Community funds for local neighbourhoods to spend on local priorities.

* New opportunities for communities to assume greater responsibility or
even ownership of community assets like village halls, community centres,
libraries or recreational facilities.
Good parish councils engage communities and make a real difference,
so we will extend the right to establish parish councils to communities
in London.

§ The nations and regions of the UK
In our first term, we devolved power to Scotland and Wales and
restored city-wide government to London. Britain is stronger as a
result. In the next Parliament, we will decentralise power further. In
Wales we will develop democratic devolution by creating a stronger
Assembly with enhanced legislative powers and a reformed structure
and electoral system to make the exercise of Assembly responsibilities
clearer and more accountable to the public. We will also review the
powers of the London Mayor and the Greater London Authority. And
we will devolve further responsibility to existing regional bodies in
relation to planning, housing, economic development and transport.

This has to end. The period of transition is over. Unionist politicians
have made it clear that they are prepared to share power with national-

all groups in Northern Ireland to make it clear they will only use dem-
ocratic and peaceful means to advance their aims.
We will work tirelessly with the parties in Northern Ireland and with
the Irish government to re-establish the devolved institutions. But this
can only happen on an inclusive basis if the IRA ends paramilitarism
and criminality for good and decommissions its weapons. Bringing
this about so that normal politics can take over in the Province will be
our principal aim.

have started with faith groups from all backgrounds about how best to
balance protection, tolerance and free speech.

We are proud to have brought in the Human Rights Act, enabling
British citizens to take action in British courts rather than having to
wait years to seek redress in Strasbourg. But rights must be balanced
by responsibilities. So we will continue to bear down on abusive or
frivolous claims.

In the next Parliament we will establish a Commission on Equality and
Human Rights to promote equality for all and, tackle discrimination,
and introduce a Single Equality Act to modernise and simplify
equality legislation.

The choice for 2010

The Tories have only one policy on democratic reform — oppor-
tunism. Arch centralisers when in office, they now claim to be
localists. Having refused for decades to accept any reform of the
archaic House of Lords, some of them now claim to support
a fully elected House. The choice is forward with new Labour to
modern institutions and more power than ever devolved to
communities and successful local authorities. Or back with
the Tories to a government indifferent to the health of our
democracy and negligent of our institutions.
