Protecting children online
Digital technology is a force for good. But as
technology develops, we need to respond to
the concerns many parents have.
Children are spending much more of their
time using screens, often unsupervised, with
research finding 63% of eight to 11-year-olds are
now using social media. We also know that the
number of children suffering from mental illness
is rising dramatically and children spend less
time playing, sleeping and socialising.
In the last decade, we have done more to
protect children online than any other country.
From next year, our Online Safety Act will
make it a legal requirement for social media
firms to protect children from illegal or harmful
content online. This includes fining social media
companies who shirk their responsibilities to
keep children safe.
But we need to do more to protect young
people and empower parents to make
decisions in the best interests of their children.
We will put our guidance on banning mobile
phones in the school day on a statutory
footing which will require all schools to operate
a ban, as the best schools already do. We will
provide funding for schools to help them ban
mobile phones where they need it.
We will urgently consult on introducing further
parental controls over access to social media.
We know this is a complex area and we need
more effective age verification and parental
controls. That’s why we will consult widely
to get this right, including developing the
necessary technology, in partnership with
other countries who are considering similar
measures. We expect to build on the existing
responsibilities set out for social media
companies under the Online Safety Act.

Championing our fishing
sector
We have taken back control of our waters
post-Brexit and will continue to back our fishing
sector to feed the nation, build long term
sustainability, and grow coastal businesses
from Shetland to Cornwall. In 2024, we
secured quotas worth over £970 million for UK
fishermen. We will go further to seek additional
opportunities for our inshore fleet in the 2026
negotiations, and ensure inshore voices are
better heard by their representative bodies.
We will replicate the £100 million UK Seafood
Fund to continue to support the sector to
thrive. The fund could be used to invest in
harbour and fish market upgrades, provide new
equipment and technology for fish processing
or to support our growing aquaculture sector.
We will particularly concentrate funding on
small and medium sized businesses and the
inshore fishing fleet. Recognising competing
pressure on marine space, we will also seek
opportunities to back the inshore fleet when
making marine planning decisions.
