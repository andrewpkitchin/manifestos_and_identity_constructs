 Winter ending

‘A cold coming we had of it’
huddled together in cardboard cities,                                                           |
crouched over shared books in leaking classrooms,
a                   crammed into peeling waiting-rooms,
aa                   ice stamped into crazy-paving                                                                      |

tentative chords behind boarded facades;                                                          |
factories open like daffodils,                                                                        |

computer-screens blink on
in the sudden daylight.
As the last cardboard boxes
are swept away beneath busy bridges,
the cold blue landscape of winter
suddenly alive with bright red roses.                                                                 |

' Foreword by the Rt. Hon. Neil Kinnock |          |

Leader of the Labour Party =.           |

This general election is a choice between a Conservative government paralysed by recession, and a Labour

government determined to get on with building recovery. —                  oo.        a           .

Gripped by the longest recession since the war, Britain needs a government with a clear sense of direction and                           |

_purpose. A government with the people and the policies to get Britain working again and to achieve sustained                     |

recovery - strength with staying power.            se                 a                   |

Labour will be such a government.                                           ;          :                     |

~ But this election is not only a choice between policies, important though both are. It is also a choice between                       |

At the core of our convictions is belief in individual liberty.                              .

O           We therefore believe:                                                                         ,

~                First, that for liberty to have real meaning the standards of community provision must be high and access to

                  that provision must be wide.

Second, that those rights of the individual must, like all others in a free society, belong to all men and women of

every age, class and ethnic origin and be balanced by responsibilities of fair contribution and law-abiding _           !

conduct.                         oe,

Third, that for rights and responsibilities to be exercised fully and fairly, government in Britain, as in other

industrialised democracies, must work to build prosperity by properly supporting research, innovation, the               |

improvement of skills, the infrastructure and long-term industrial development.

Our vision for Britain is founded on these values. Guided by them, we will make our country more                   |

competitive, creative, and just; more secure against crime, aggression and environmental danger. We want

government to serve the whole nation - using its power to realise this vision.                                                     |

Labour will be such a government.

These are our convictions and we will work to fulfil them. They are also down-to-earth aims - essential               |

objectives in a country hit by recession, suffering run-down public services and facing the intensifying pressures

of European and global economic competition.                                      |

All of those realities require that the government provides: a stable economic environment; education and                  |

.                 training that fosters the abilities of all young people and adults; a firm emphasis on productive investment in both

C }        the public and private sectors.                                                                                                         |

                     Labour will implement and maintain those policies. They are vital for prosperity, for consistently low inflation

and for continuous improvement in economic performance and living standards. They are also fundamental to

improving the quality and quantity of provision in health and social services, and to combating poverty. We have                            |

absolute commitment to a high-quality National Health Service, free at time of need and not fractured and                |

weakened by underfunding and a commercialised contract system. We will get on with fulfilling that                   |

commitment from the moment of our election - by strengthening and modernising the NHS, by extending care

in the community and by establishing the National Health Initiative to prevent illness.

Our pledges to increase the income of pensioners and families with children will urgently be fulfilled. Our                   |

_ undertakings to stop the perpetual experiments in schools and to raise standards of investment and achievement

in education will be kept in full.

These policies - like those to increase house-building, improve transport and protect the environment - are not                             |

only important to the well-being of the British people now. They are vital preparations for the future. In that                    |

future, we are determined that Britain will be a leader in the New Europe, setting higher standards and not .       |
surrendering influence by opting out. We have confidence in our country and in the qualities and potential ofits .  -

people. We want to nourish their artistic, scientific, sporting and other abilities. And we want to enhance their

democratic power too. We shall therefore make constitutional and other changes that will give renewed vitalityto

our democracy. We shall empower people as citizens and as consumers of public and private services. We        |

~ These policies, like many others, manifést our practical commitment to freedom. That purpose is not
confined to the shores of our country. In an age where liberty has made great advances in the world, there                        |
is still conflict, instability and want, causing great misery and inhibiting the peace and co-operation              |
which we want to help to build. We shall, therefore, ensure that our country has the defence capacity, the                        |
strength of alliance and the peace-making ‘commitment necessary to safeguard the United Kingdom, to
participate in international negotiations for disarmament, to deter aggression and to contribute to
constructing a New World Order, now feasible through the strengthened United Nations.                    |
In our relations with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe as well as with the ©
poverty-stricken peoples of the South, we will work from the principle that political freedom needs the
sure foundation of economic security. In this increasingly inter-dependent world there are no distant
crises. The Labour government will therefore, as a matter of moral obligation and in the material            |
interests of our country, foster the development and trade relationships necessary for the advance of              |
O         economic security, political democracy and respect for human rights.                                                 |
“            The United Kingdom has been through 13 years in which unemployment has more than doubled,              |
irreplaceable assets have been wasted, markets at home and abroad have been lost, manufacturing            |
.           investment has fallen, poverty has increased, the crime rate has rocketed, and talents have been          |
                neglected.                                                                                                                          |
                 Now our country faces clear alternatives.                                                                             |

|                        A Conservative government would mean a repeat of the same, stale policies which brought economic

                     insecurity, privatised and underfunded public services and increased social division. The Conservatives
              have no policies which would mean sustained recovery, higher health care or improved educational             |
                         standards. The arrogance remains which brought us the poll tax, centralisation in Britain and isolation in                      |
|                Europe.                                                                                                                            |
If they can’t get it right in 13 years, they never will.                           |
The Labour government will mean a fresh start for Britain. It will mean strong and continued          |
emphasis on investment for economic strength. It will mean action to help families, fair taxation,

incentives for enterprise and support for essential community services.
It will mean greater freedom, security and opportunity. It will mean change for the better.
                  It’s time to make that change.
             It’s time for Labour.                                                                                                     |
