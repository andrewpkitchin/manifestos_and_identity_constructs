rest on the foundation of sound

finances. Labour will therefore

set the target of eliminating the

government's deficit on day-to-day

spending within five years.

But government must have a laser-

like focus on how we earn, as well as

how we spend. At the same time as

eliminating the current deficit, Labour

will invest in our future, to ensure

faster growth and help us to earn

our way as a country again.

To maintain good fiscal health, we will

have a firm rule in place to guide all

our taxation and spending decisions.

Our Fiscal Credibility Rule is based on

the simple principle that government

should not be borrowing for day-to-

day spending, but that future growth

depends on investment. It was

designed in conjunction with world-

leading economists. It also means we

are committed to ensuring that the

national debt is lower at the end of

the next Parliament than it is today.

Compliance with the rule will be

overseen by a strengthened and

truly independent Office for Budget

Education is what empowers us
all to realise our full potential.
When it fails, it isn’t just the
individual that is held back,
but all of us. When we invest in
people to develop their skills and
capabilities, we all benefit from a
stronger economy and society.
At a time when working lives and
the skills our economy needs are
changing rapidly, governments have
the responsibility to make lifelong
learning a reality by giving everyone
the opportunity to access education
throughout their lives.
To meet this responsibility, Labour
will create a unified National
Education Service (NES) for England
to move towards cradle-to-grave
learning that is free at the point
of use. The NES will be built on the
principle that ‘Every Child - and Adult
- Matters’ and will incorporate all
forms of education, from early
years through to adult education.

statutory bereavement leave, for time
off work after the loss of close family
members. We will also consult on
toughening the law against assaulting
workers who have to enforce laws
such as age-related sales or ticketing
arrangements, and who face regular
abuse.

Labour will maintain the ACAS Early

workplace issues efficiently, and we
will protect the current compromise

Labour will also legislate to permit
secure online and workplace balloting

Workers in Britain are among

the easiest and cheapest to

make redundant, meaning when
multinational companies are taking
decisions to downsize that British
workers are at a disadvantage. We

Britain more into line with their

Soaring rents are a real problem

- leading to more families living in

temporary accommodation, more

people sleeping rough, and many

not having enough money to save

up for a deposit or for a rainy day.

Labour will make new three-year

tenancies the norm, with an inflation

cap on rent rises. Given the particular

pressures in London we will look at

giving the Mayor the power to give

renters in London additional security.

We will legislate to ban letting agency

fees for tenants.

We will also empower tenants to

call time on bad landlords by giving

renters new consumer rights. Renters

are spending £9.6 billion a year on

homes that the government classes

as ‘non-decent’. Around a quarter

of this is paid by housing benefit.

A Labour government would

introduce new legal minimum

standards to ensure properties

are ‘fit for human habitation’ and

empower tenants to take action if

their rented homes are sub-standard.

Homelessness is not inevitable in
a country as decent and well off
as ours. However, since 2010 the
number of people sleeping rough
in shop doorways and on park
benches has more than doubled.
This shames us all. There can be
no excuses - it must end. Full stop.
More families are living in temporary
accommodation, meaning 120,000
children spent last Christmas without
a home to call their own.

This growing homelessness shames
the Conservatives. The spiralling

rise in street homelessness results
directly from decisions made by

the Conservatives on pay, housing,
mental health and social security.
Labour will set out a new national
plan to end rough sleeping within
the next Parliament, starting by
making available 4,000 additional
homes reserved for people with a
history of rough sleeping. We will
also take action to tackle the root
causes of homelessness, including
safeguarding homeless hostels and
other supported housing from crude
Conservative cuts to housing benefit.

The peace we have today in

Northern Ireland is due to the

courageous endeavours of

those on all sides who have

been brave enough to build it.

The Good Friday Agreement, which

Labour helped to negotiate, is one

of the greatest achievements of

Labour in office.

We will continue to fully support the

principles and structures inherent

within the Good Friday Agreement

and we remain committed to

working with all sides to deliver

real peace and greater prosperity

to Northern Ireland.

Maternity discrimination under

the Conservatives is out of control,
almost doubling in the past ten years.
Many mothers are reluctant to raise
complaints about discrimination and
unfair treatment. Unlawful maternity
and pregnancy discrimination is

now more common in Britain's
workplaces than ever before, with
54,000 pregnant women and new
mothers forced out of their jobs in
2015. Labour will reverse the unfair
employment tribunal fees which
literally price people out of justice.
Labour will also extend the time
period for applying for maternity
discrimination to the employment
tribunal from three to six months.
Labour will work with the Health

and Safety Executive to make
mandatory a workplace risk
assessment for pregnant women

so necessary adaptions can be
made, and review support for
women who have miscarriages.

makes to the UK economy. However,
we also believe that strong export
controls have a vital role to play in
sustaining a legitimate trade in arms,
while protecting UK jobs and R&D.
Labour will therefore implement the
Arms Trade Treaty to a consistently
high standard, including ceasing
arms exports to countries where
there is concern that they will be
used to violate international
humanitarian law (IHL).

In particular, Labour will demand a
comprehensive, independent, UN-led
investigation into alleged violations of
IHL in Yemen, including air strikes on
civilians by the Saudi-led coalition. We
will immediately suspend any further
arms sales for use in the conflict until
that investigation is concluded.

independent inquiry into Britain’s
military role in the 1984 raid on the
