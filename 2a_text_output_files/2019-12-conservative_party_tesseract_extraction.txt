great new deal — despite Parliament's best efforts to block his progress.

Revive our towns

and cities
People across the UK are rightly
proud of where they come from, and
of their local areas. But too many
communities feel let down. Violent
crime and anti-social behaviour are
ignored amid a backdrop of boarded-
up department stores, shops and
pubs. Great towns and cities are
being held back.
We as Conservatives want to give you
freedom — low taxes, opportunity, the
chance to realise your dreams. But we
also want to give you security — safe and
pleasant streets, and the ability to take
pride and comfort from the community
around you.
This is why, in his first months as Prime
Minister, Boris Johnson has set out
an agenda for levelling up every part
of the UK — not just investing in our
great towns and cities, as well as rural
and coastal areas, but giving them far
more control of how that investment is
made. In the 21st century, we need to
get away from the idea that ‘Whitehall
knows best’ and that all growth must
inevitably start in London. Because we
as Conservatives believe you can and
must trust people and communities to
make the decisions that are right for
them.

As Conservatives, we are immensely proud of the UK's history and its standing in the world.
Unlike those currently leading the Labour Party, we view our country as a force for good.
The strength of the Armed Forces, our alliances with like-minded democracies and our
willingness to act are all reasons for the UK to hold its head high.
So too is our work in promoting international development and fighting climate change —
both issues on which the Conservative Party and Conservative Governments have driven
the agenda forward.
