Why should we Vote Leave on 23 June?
• David Cameron’s deal leaves the EU in charge of the same 
things after as before his negotiation
• It is not legally binding – the European Court can tear it up 
the day after the referendum
• This is dangerous. We will keep sending at least £350 million 
a week to the EU
• Immigration will continue to be out of control putting 
public services like the NHS under strain
• The European Court will be in charge of our borders, 
immigration, asylum and even our intelligence services
• If we Vote Leave, we will take back control and can spend 
Our money, our priorities
The EU costs us over £350 million a week
Enough to build a brand new, fully-staffed NHS hospital every week
This is almost £20 billion a year
Half the entire English schools budget, or four times the annual Scottish schools 
budget and four times the science budget
Since 1973, we have sent over half a trillion pounds to the EU
Our money, our priorities
We should spend our money on our priorities like the NHS not the EU
Let’s take back control of our borders
• A quarter of a million EU migrants come here every year – a city 
the size of Newcastle
• This puts a big strain on public services like the NHS and schools
• The EU Court means we can’t stop violent convicted criminals  
coming here from Europe
• The EU Court also stops us from deporting dangerous terror 
suspects
We need to take back control of our borders so we decide who can come here – and who can’t
We can’t take the risk of voting to stay
• The euro is permanently on the brink of crisis – and we will 
be forced to pay to bail it out again
• The EU’s migrant crisis is out of control 
• EU Judges are using the Charter of Fundamental Rights to take away more power from our police and security services
• The former head of Interpol, Ronald K Noble, has said that: 
“Europe’s open-border arrangement… is effectively an international passport-free zone for terrorists” and that it is like “hanging a sign welcoming terrorists to Europe”
Voting to stay in the EU is a threat to our jobs and our security
The EU is letting in more and more countries
• The EU started as 9 countries 
– it’s now 28
• Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria have joined since 2007
• Five more members with a total population of more than 88 million are being lined up to join
The EU will continue to grow. The next countries set to join are: Albania: 2.8 million Macedonia: 2.1 million Montenegro: 0.6 million Serbi : 7.2 million Turkey: 76.0 million
We need to be able to hold our lawmakers to account
• Over half our laws are made by unelected EU bureaucrats in Brussels for whom we never voted
• The Eurozone has a permanent majority in the EU voting system – this means we’re always outvoted
• The UK has been outvoted every single time it has voted     
against EU laws
• These laws have cost British taxpayers £2.4 billion
We should take back the power to kick out the people who make our laws
Let’s take back control over our economy and trade
• Only 5% of British businesses export to the EU but 100% suffer 
the burden of EU red tape
• EU regulations are highly damaging to our economy, costing 
small businesses millions every week
• EU energy regulations cost families and small businesses 
millions
• EU rules delay building schools and hospitals – and add millions 
to the cost
• We have no power to make free trade deals with fast growing 
economies like India and China – or even key allies like Australia 
and New Zealand
UK trade and jobs will thrive after we Vote Leave
Great Britain is a great country
•	 We are the 5th biggest economy in the world
•	 We are the 4th largest military power in the world
•	 We are one of 5 permanent members of the UN Security 
Council and a leading member of NATO
•	 Our security and intelligence services are recognised as 
the best in the world
•	 We have 4 of the world’s top 10 universities
The ‘In’ campaign claim that we can’t be a normal 
democracy which stands on our own two feet 
– they are doing Britain down
We love Europe – the problem is the EU
•	 There is a free trade zone stretching all the way from 
Iceland to the Russian border. We will still be part of it 
after we Vote Leave
•	 We don’t need to accept the control of the EU Court to 
trade with Europe
•	 Countries around the world trade with the EU without 
accepting the ultimate control of the EU court
•	 Taking back control is a careful change, not a sudden 
step – we will negotiate the terms of a new deal before 
we start any legal process to leave
We might not get another vote on this for forty years 
or more – let’s use our chance
David Cameron’s deal 
is a complete failure
•	 It doesn’t save us any money – we are still sending 
£350 million a week to the EU
•	 This will increase to £400m a week by 2020
•	 It is not legally binding – the European Court can rip up 
the agreement the day after the referendum
•	 The European Court has already broken a similar 
agreement with Denmark 80 times
The European Court is still in charge of exactly 
the same things as it was before
The EU is already planning 
its next power grab
•	 The EU Commission has already published its plans for the 
next EU treaty in the Five Presidents’ Report
•	 This will transfer a huge amount more power to Brussels – 
including over our taxes
•	 The UK stands to lose out hugely – we will lose even more 
control and money and our public services like the NHS will 
be under even more strain
•	 The Eurocrats are just waiting to get our referendum out of 
the way before pushing ahead with the new treaty to take 
even more money and power
This is our last chance to take back control 
– there is no status quo on offer
A vote to stay in the EU means:
Permanent handing over of £350 million a week to Brussels
Permanent overruling of UK law by EU law and the EU Court
Permanent EU control of our trade and economy
Permanent EU control of security and migration
A vote to stay in the EU is a vote to keep giving more 
money and power to the EU every year
A Vote to Leave takes back control
We stop handing over £350 million a week to Brussels
We take back control of our borders and can kick out violent criminals
We take back the power to kick out the people who make our laws
We decide what we spend our own money on
We free our businesses from damaging EU laws and regulations
We take back the power to make our own trade deals
We have better relations with our European friends
We regain our influence in the wider world and become a truly global nation once again
Europe yes, EU no – the safer choice
