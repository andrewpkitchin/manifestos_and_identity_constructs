FOREWORD
            At the end of this Parliament a new Millennium will be in view. We must raise our sights high. This
|                Manifesto is about making our country respected and secure, and helping you achieve a better, safer and
more prosperous future. For I believe - strongly - that you, and not the Government, should be in charge
of your life. That’s what Conservatism stands for. That principle underlies all the policies in this Manifesto.

aoTHE BEST FUTURE FOR BRITAIN
WEALTH AND OWNERSHIP
The 1990s present a great economic opportunity for Britain. We have got the scourge of inflation
under control. We have cut direct tax rates. And a stable currency gives industry a chance to realise
the potential released by the reforms of the 1980s.
We have extended ownership more widely - of homes, savings and shares - with millions more sharing
directly in Britain’s success. We will promote enterprise through low taxes, sound money and a stable
currency.

services to set clear standards - and to tell the public how far those standards are met.

OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL
Conservatives  believe that high standards in education and training are the  key to personal
opportunity and national success. We believe in partnership with parents, choice in schools and a
good grounding in the basic skills all children need to make a success of their lives. We are committed
to widening opportunities without compromising academic standards. We will continue to expand
higher education and training. We will reinforce the rights of the individual in the world of work, and
break down artificial barriers to advancement. By extending opportunity and arming people with the
power to choose, we will give valuable freedoms and a powerful spur to achievement.

A BRIGHTER BRITAIN

Making Britain a brighter and better place in which to live requires a high quality physical        |
environment - including housing, transport and reinvigorated urban areas. The Conservative
commitment is both to the re-creation of our civic pride and also to the preservation and integrity of
our rural heritage, founded on the core industry of agriculture. Our aim is to enhance the quality of
life for the British people.

worked, and frequently fought, side by side. Together, we have made a unique mark on history.             :

Nationalist plans for independence are a recipe for weakness and isolation.  Higher taxes and political                      |
uncertainty would deter investment and destroy jobs. The costly Labour and Liberal devolution            |
proposals for Scotland and Wales have the same drawbacks. They do not intend to bring about            |
separation, but run that risk. They could feed, but not resolve, grievances that arise in different parts           |
of Britain. They would deprive Scotland and Wales of their rightful seats in the United Kingdom    CO)     |

The plans for devolution put forward by the other parties would have a gtave impact not just on             |
Scotland and Wales, but also on England. They propose new and costly regional assemblies in
England, for which there is no demand. We will oppose all such unnecessary layers of government.                    ,
The Union has brought us strength both economically and politically. Yet it has preserved the historic
