tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and abuse. Schemes

criminal smuggler gangs, is undermining our security and costing lives.

action, and our intention to lead on
this agenda.
Regaining Britain’s global leadership
on development is a key part of our
plan to reconnect with our allies
and partners. Labour will strengthen
international development work
within the Foreign, Commonwealth
& Development Office. We will renew
expertise and focus, especially in
priority areas such as supporting
economic transformation, tackling
unsustainable debt, empowering
women and girls, supporting
conflict prevention, and unlocking
climat e finance.

rest of the funding coming from responsible borrowing to invest within
Labour's fiscal rules — catalytic investment that will leverage higher
private investment and boost economic growth.

Manifesto 2024At this election we can change Britain.
We can stop the chaos, turn the page, and start to rebuild
our country.
A country restored to the service of working people; united in
the common determination to build and share wealth. And with
a renewed confidence that the future will be better for our children.
This manifesto contains our plan to
begin that work.
&    To succeed we will need every individual and community to
play their part. We must come together, after 14 years of chaos
and division.
That is what Britain needs —
and we hope you will join us
in this national endeavour.
